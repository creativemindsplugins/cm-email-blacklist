**Protect your WordPress site from unauthorized access and spam by utilizing our specialized blacklist plugin.**

This solution offers you the ability to set up custom rules that filter out unwanted registrations, giving you the power to block users based on specific criteria such as domain, IP, and email addresses. By tailoring these settings, you can maintain a secure and clean user base.

On the flip side, the plugin’s whitelist feature allows for a more open yet controlled registration process. You can specify which email domains, usernames, or IP addresses are allowed, ensuring that only pre-approved users can sign up. This dual-functionality provides a robust framework for managing site access.

In essence, our WordPress blacklist plugin is a comprehensive tool for site protection. It affords you the flexibility to define who can and cannot register, safeguarding your site against spam and maintaining the integrity of your user community. With its customizable blacklist and whitelist options, you can create a secure environment that supports your site’s growth and user engagement.

## Installation and Usage

* Put the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder on your WordPress site.
* Turn on the plugin by finding it in the ‘Plugins’ section of your WordPress dashboard and clicking ‘Activate’.
* You can find and change the settings for your CM Email Blacklist in the admin menu on the left side of your dashboard.

Remember: Your website’s theme needs to have a `wp_head()` function for the plugin’s JavaScript files to work. If your theme doesn’t have this, you’ll need to add the JavaScript files to your theme yourself, but it’s better not to do this. Also, the plugin needs at least PHP version 5.3.0 to work because it uses some newer features. If you have an older version of PHP, the plugin won’t work.
